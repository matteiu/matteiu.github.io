Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Brown University. I am an applied economist and my research currently focuses on development economics, political economics, and long run economic growth.

In my job market paper, I use a regression discontinuity design to show how poverty alleviating cash transfers targeting women in Pakistan are changing their attitudes toward welfare.

Before joining Brown, I studied in Milan at Bocconi University, where I obtained a B.Sc. in Finance and a M.Sc. in Economics, and I spent one year in the research division of the European Central Bank. I worked for Amazon over the summer.
