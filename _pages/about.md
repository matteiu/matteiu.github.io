Welcome! I am an applied economist and my research currently focuses on development economics, political economics, and long run economic growth.

Before joining Brown, I studied in Milan at Bocconi University, where I obtained a B.Sc. in Finance and a M.Sc. in Economics, and I spent one year in the research division of the European Central Bank. I worked for Amazon over the summer.
