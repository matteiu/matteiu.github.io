**Welcome!** I am an applied economist and my research currently focuses on development economics, political economics, and long run economic growth.

In my job market paper, I use a regression discontinuity design to show how poverty alleviating cash transfers targeting women in Pakistan are changing their attitudes toward welfare.

Before joining [Brown](https://economics.brown.edu), I studied in Milan at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/), where I obtained a B.Sc. in Finance and a M.Sc. in Economics, and I spent one year in the research division of the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/). I'll be a returning intern at [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com) during the summer of 2021.
